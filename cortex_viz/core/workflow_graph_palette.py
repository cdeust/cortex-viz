"""Color palette for the workflow graph — tuned for maximum kind separation.

Each semantic family sits in a distinct hue band so glance-to-legend
identifies which node to click:

* YELLOW/GOLD → Cortex identity + shell (domain, command)
* ORANGE     → user-invoked slash commands (skill)
* PINK/RED   → human-actor interactions (agent, task, discussion)
* PURPLE     → integrations (hook, MCP)
* GREEN      → authorship (edit/write + memory lifecycle)
* CYAN       → information intake (read)
* FUCHSIA    → search (grep/glob)

Pure data. Imports the enum types from ``workflow_graph_schema`` so the
palette can stay keyed by ``ToolKind`` / ``PrimaryToolCluster`` without
a circular dependency (this module is only imported by the schema and
builder — never the other way round).
