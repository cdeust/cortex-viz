"""Wiki coverage audit — find missing scopes per project (domain).

Pure business logic — no I/O. The handler composes this with the wiki
filesystem scan.

Problem this module solves
==========================

The auto-curator (``cortex_viz.core.auto_curator``) clusters memories by
dominant entity. That is bottom-up: it surfaces topics the user *worked
on*, but it can't see what the user *didn't write yet*. As a result,
high-traffic topics get many pages while structural scopes — overall
architecture, public APIs, data flow, runbooks — can remain undocumented
even when the codebase is mature.

This module is the top-down counterpart. Given a project (domain), it
checks whether each canonical *scope* is documented and returns the
missing scopes as authoring intents the LLM can consume in the same
shape as cluster-driven jobs.

Scopes (canonical, ordered by structural primacy)
-------------------------------------------------

  * ``architecture`` — overall design, layers, dependency rule.
    Anchor page: ``reference/<domain>/architecture-overview.md``.
  * ``services`` — major components / modules / handlers / services.
    Anchor pages: ``reference/<domain>/<component>-overview.md``.
  * ``api`` — external surface (CLI, HTTP, MCP tools, library API).
    Anchor page: ``reference/<domain>/api.md``.
  * ``data-flow`` — read/write/consolidation paths, lifecycle of a
    record from ingest to retrieval.
    Anchor page: ``reference/<domain>/data-flow.md``.
  * ``operations`` — runbooks, deploy, observability, on-call.
    Anchor pages under ``runbook/<domain>/``.
  * ``decisions`` — task-records / ADRs. Anchor pages under
    ``adr/<domain>/``.

Each scope is *covered* when at least one substantive page exists for it
under the right path. Substantive means: the file exists, is over a
minimum size, and is not a stub.

Why not infer scopes from memory tags
-------------------------------------

Memory tags are noisy and per-event. Scopes are stable structural
categories of *what every codebase needs documented*. Hard-coding the
six scopes is the right tradeoff: the list is short, the categories are
universal across the projects Cortex sees, and changes to the list are
a deliberate edit here, not an emergent property of tag drift.

      * If the scope has no anchor filenames (``decisions``), any
        substantive page in its directories counts after the minimum
        page count is met (default 1).
      * If ``max_age_days`` is set (default 90), anchor pages older than
        the window count as missing so the auto-curator refreshes them.

    Pass ``max_age_days=None`` to disable freshness checks — the older
    "any anchor counts" semantics.

# the wiki. The reference can be inside an architecture page that lists
# the file, a services page that names it, a dedicated file-doc, or an
# ADR that touched it. Anything that isn't named anywhere is a hole.

# a reader following the wiki should never encounter a file in the
# repo that has no breadcrumb back to a wiki page.
