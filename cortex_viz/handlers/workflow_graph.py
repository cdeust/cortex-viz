    The output shape mirrors the legacy ``/api/graph`` response
    (``{nodes, edges, meta}``) so the existing bridge in
    workflow_graph_bridge.js can auto-detect it and route to the new
    renderer.

    Progressive-reveal stages so the first response comes back
    instantly and heavy data streams in as it becomes available:

      * ``skeleton`` — domains, skills, hooks, agents, tool hubs, MCPs,
        memories, discussions, commands. **No file nodes, no AST.**
        This is what the client sees on the very first request.
      * ``files``    — skeleton plus the file nodes derived from
        Claude-session tool events and command-file attribution.
      * ``full``     — everything including AST symbols + edges from
        every indexed AP graph. Used for the final steady-state cache.

    The background enricher in ``http_standalone_graph`` drives this
    sequence: it publishes a skeleton within ~500ms, then republishes
    files, then republishes with AST. The client polls every 4s and
    renders the deltas so projects / files / symbols fade in instead of
    popping in all at once.

    Streaming hooks (added 2026-05-27 to address the synchronous-blob
    measurement on ``wip/layout-authority-sse-streaming``):

      * ``on_source_loaded(label, count)`` — invoked after every PG
        query returns, before any ingestion. Lets the caller post
        progress messages ("loaded 6,315 memories") so the client
        sees the work *in flight* rather than only the result. Pure
        observability, no behavioural effect.
      * ``on_batch(label, new_nodes, new_edges)`` — invoked after the
        builder finishes ingesting one source. Lets the caller push
        the delta into the LayoutAuthority / SSE producer immediately
        instead of waiting for the whole graph to be built. The yielded
        edges are already intra-batch deduped (see
        ``WorkflowGraphBuilder.streaming_build`` docstring); the final
        return dict is unchanged from the non-streaming path.
