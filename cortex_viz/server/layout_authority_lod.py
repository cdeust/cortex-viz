"""Fractal level-of-detail subsampler for the layout authority.

Principle (Mandelbrot 1982, *The Fractal Geometry of Nature*):
    Graph structure is self-similar across scales. At full zoom the user
    needs every symbol; at far zoom only domain/tool/file scaffolding
    matters. Decimation by a deterministic hash keyed on (node_id, zoom)
    yields the SAME visible subset across reconnects — clients can drop
    and rejoin without the visible population shifting.

The decimation rule is power-law in stride:

    stride(zoom) = max(1, int(2 ** (3 - zoom * 4)))

    zoom=1.00 → stride=1   (all symbols visible)
    zoom=0.75 → stride=1
    zoom=0.50 → stride=2   (≈ half)
    zoom=0.25 → stride=4   (≈ quarter)
    zoom=0.00 → stride=8   (≈ 1/8)

Visible-count vs stride is approximately a power law (slope -1 on log-log)
because |visible| ≈ N / stride. This is the Mandelbrot signature: the
information density scales as a power of the resolution, not as a
constant. See `tasks/layout-authority/audits/mandelbrot.md`.

This module is pure logic. Imports stdlib only. No I/O.
