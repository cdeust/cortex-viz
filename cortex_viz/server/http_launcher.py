         set ``CORTEX_DEV_SOURCE_SYNC=1`` as an explicit opt-in. The
         flag signals "I deliberately want my CORTEX_DEV_ROOT to be
         used as a code-execution dev source"; without it the env
         var is ignored.
      2. The file the launcher module was loaded from, if it's inside
         a Cortex source tree (auto-detect for ``pip install -e .``
         / ``uv run`` dev mode). This is filesystem-position-based:
         the attacker would have to place the launcher module itself
         inside their malicious project to influence it, which
         requires write access to the user's site-packages and is
         therefore higher-privileged than the exploit it would yield.

    There is NO hardcoded checkout path. A client install has no dev
    tree; signal 2 resolves the install root itself, so the sync
    no-ops. Hardcoding ``$HOME/Documents/...`` was wrong — it never
    matches a real client and mis-fires on developer machines whose
    checkout lives elsewhere.

    ``CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`` (set automatically by Claude Code to
    whatever project the user has open) is **NOT** consulted: per
    EQSTLab's 2026-05-27 advisory, that path is attacker-controllable
    via social-engineering ("open this repo to reproduce the bug")
    and combined with the two-marker ``_is_cortex_root`` check it
    constituted a local arbitrary-code-execution surface (the
    returned dev source is passed to ``rsync`` and then the
    visualization server respawns from the synced copy).

    A directory qualifies only if it contains both ``mcp_server/`` and
    ``ui/unified-viz.html``. When a dev source is returned
    ``launch_server`` rsyncs it over the package path and restarts the
    HTTP server so the visualization always reflects the current
