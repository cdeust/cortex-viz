"""Delta protocol for the Cortex layout authority.

Three input verbs (the authority RECEIVES these from the build worker):
    add_node(NodeDelta)        — a new node has been produced
    add_edge(EdgeDelta)        — a new edge has been produced
    request_subtree(domain_id) — re-emit slot assignments for one subtree

One output event (the authority PRODUCES these on the SSE stream):
    SlotAssignment             — node_id has been placed at (x, y)

Contracts here are NORMATIVE. Producers and consumers MUST honor them.
A violation is a bug. The authority's reference implementation enforces
them with assertions in debug mode and best-effort recovery in prod.

This module is contract-only. Imports stdlib only. No I/O, no logic.
A separate engineer agent will write the reference implementation in
``layout_authority.py`` integrating with the Carnot geometry module
(``layout_authority_geometry.py``), the Hamilton scheduler, and the
Lamport event log.

INVARIANTS = """
I1. SlotAssignment.x and SlotAssignment.y are finite floats; never
    NaN, never inf. Verified at emission time.

I2. SlotAssignment.seq is strictly monotonically increasing per
    authority instance. For any two SlotAssignments with the same
    node_id (which can only occur after request_subtree), the LATER
    one (higher seq) supersedes the earlier. Clients MUST update by
    seq.

I3. SlotAssignment for a 'symbol' node_id must arrive AFTER the
    SlotAssignment for its parent file. If the file is missing,
    the symbol is buffered. Symbol slot is computed from parent
    file's slot, NOT from the domain anchor directly.

I4. SlotAssignment for a 'file' node_id may arrive before its primary
    tool_hub if the build worker emits files first. The authority
    falls back to placing the file at the domain hub if no tool_hub
    is yet known; the slot is FINAL — no retroactive reseat.

I5. The pending-edges buffer has a bounded size (default 100k). When
    full, the oldest pending edges are dropped (with a counter
    incremented). The build worker MUST emit dependencies in order
    most of the time; the buffer is for transient races only.

I6. add_node, add_edge, request_subtree never block. If the internal
    work queue is full, they drop the event and increment a counter.
    The producer (build worker) is never stalled by the authority.

I7. domain_id on every NodeDelta and SlotAssignment is non-empty and
    refers to a node whose kind == 'domain'. The 'domain' node for
    a domain_id MAY arrive after its members; in that case those
    members' slots are computed against a placeholder anchor and
    are FINAL (no retroactive reseat — same rule as I4).
