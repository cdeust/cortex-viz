"""Bridge to the ``automatised-pipeline`` sibling MCP server (ADR-0046).

AP is a Rust MCP server that indexes codebases into a property graph
(tree-sitter → LadybugDB → Louvain → BM25 + TF-IDF + RRF) and exposes
23 tools. Cortex consumes a subset of those tools — indexing, graph
queries, symbol lookup, search — to add AST-level depth to its
workflow graph.

Enabled by default (``MemorySettings.AP_ENABLED = True``) so the L6
symbol ring has depth out of the box. Users cut token / subprocess
cost by setting ``CORTEX_MEMORY_AP_ENABLED=0`` in their MCP config.
When off, no connection is attempted, every call returns an empty
result, and the workflow graph falls back to the native in-process
AST source.

Infrastructure layer only. No core imports.
