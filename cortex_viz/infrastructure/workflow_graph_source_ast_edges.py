"""Per-graph async edge-batch loader for the AST workflow-graph source.

Split out of ``workflow_graph_source_ast.py`` (was 917 lines) to respect
the 500-line file limit. Holds ``_edge_batches_async`` — the async
generator that enumerates AP's typed rel tables (Calls_*, Imports_*,
HasMethod_*, Uses_*, Defines_File_Import) and yields one batch per
rel-table query. Pure infrastructure — no core imports.

``workflow_graph_source_ast`` re-exports this so existing import paths
keep resolving.
