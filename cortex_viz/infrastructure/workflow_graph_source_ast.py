"""AST-backed loader for the workflow graph (ADR-0046).

Peer of ``workflow_graph_source_pg`` / ``workflow_graph_source_jsonl``.
Calls the ``automatised-pipeline`` MCP server via ``ap_bridge`` and
returns builder-shaped dicts for symbol nodes and the AST edges
(``defined_in``, ``calls``, ``imports``, ``member_of``).

Constrained to the Cortex-known file set: AP may have indexed files
that Cortex doesn't know about (e.g. vendored dependencies); we filter
so the graph stays focused on what the user's sessions actually touch.

Pure infrastructure — no core imports. When AP is disabled
(``CORTEX_MEMORY_AP_ENABLED=0``) or unreachable, every loader returns
``[]`` so the workflow graph degrades to the native in-process AST
source in ``workflow_graph_source_native_ast``.
